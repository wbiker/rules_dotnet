Runtime considerations
======================

Runtime setup
-------------

Bazel rules maintain the list of files required to run given executable. When the run
is requested (via bazel run or bazel test) then a manifest file is generated by Bazel.
Rules_dotnet uses this file to link all runtime files in the same directory as the
executable to run. 

.NET Core
---------

Bazel works best in the `monorepo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo>`_ scenario
where all dependencies are built by it using the same .NET Core runtime version.
An attempt to build some common open source libraries is maintained 
`here <https://github.com/tomaszstrejczek/rules_dotnet_3rd_party>`_.

However, many .NET Core projects are composed of multiple dependencies gathered via
Nuget. Those dependencies are often built using different versions of .NET Core.
Typically, msbuild-based build systems handle it automatically by providing 
appropriate deps.json and runtimeconfig.json files. See 
`this article <https://natemcmaster.com/blog/2017/12/21/netcore-primitives/>`_
for a very interesting overview.

Unfoortunately, Bazel dotnet rules currently are not able to generate these files. 
Therefore, if multiple versions of .NET Core are mixed then a user has to provide 
them manually.

.NET Framework
--------------

.NET Framework uses `Global Assembly Cache <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/gac>`_.
Therefore, the runtime .NET Framework dependencies linked by rules_dotnet are
not used if the assembly existst in the GAC. It may lead to unexpected errors, particularly
when using Nuget packages.
